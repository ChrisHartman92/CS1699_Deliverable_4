Yes, Avagadro's number is used to compute the results of chemical reactions.
Johann Josef Loschmidt
Johann Josef Loschmidt first calculated the value of Avogadro's number.
The relationship between the masses of the same volume of different gases (at the same temperature and pressure) corresponds to the relationship between their respective molecular weights
Avogadro's Law states that the relationship between the masses of the same volume of different gases (at the same temperature and pressure) corresponds to the relationship between their respective molecular weights.
